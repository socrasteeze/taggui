## Installation

### Windows (this fork)

1. Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.11 also works).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Double-click [`run.bat`](run.bat) (first run downloads dependencies,
   including the large PyTorch CUDA wheel).
4. Optional: double-click [`create_shortcut.bat`](create_shortcut.bat), or use
   **Tools → Create Desktop Shortcut…** inside the app.

Later launches skip pip when `venv\installed-requirements.txt` still matches
`requirements.txt`. Use `run.bat update` to force a reinstall.

### GPU tagging with the WD taggers (optional)

The WD taggers run through ONNX Runtime, and `requirements.txt` pins the CPU
package so the install works everywhere. Batch-tagging thousands of images is
much faster on the GPU — to enable it, replace the CPU package with the one
matching your hardware:

```
venv\Scripts\pip uninstall -y onnxruntime
venv\Scripts\pip install onnxruntime-gpu        # NVIDIA / CUDA
venv\Scripts\pip install onnxruntime-directml   # Windows without CUDA
```

The app picks the CUDA or DirectML provider automatically when one is
installed and the device is set to GPU, and falls back to CPU otherwise, so
nothing else needs changing.

### Captioner model requirements

Newer captioners need newer `transformers`, and the app checks before loading:
a model that needs a newer release says so, naming the version, instead of
failing with an unrecognised-architecture error.

| Captioner | Needs |
|---|---|
| Qwen3-VL (2B / 4B / 8B / 30B-A3B) | `transformers>=4.57` — the pinned version |
| Gemma 4 | `transformers>=5.5` — **not** the pinned version, see below |
| WD taggers, pixai-tagger | ONNX Runtime only — `transformers` is not involved |
| Everything else | the pinned version |

`requirements.txt` pins 4.57.6, the last of the 4.x line. To use Gemma 4,
raise that pin to a 5.x release and re-run `run.bat update`. The app works on
either — it adapts to both API shapes — but the tradeoff is worth knowing:
on 5.x, Florence-2 gains native support (no `trust_remote_code`), while
Phi-3-Vision and Moondream still rely on remote code written against the 4.x
API and are the two to re-check.

### Development

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

The suite runs headless and needs neither a GPU nor the captioning
dependencies. Model loading itself is verified on real hardware.

### Upstream releases / manual install

The easiest way to use the **upstream** application is to download the latest
release from the [releases page](https://www.github.com/jhc13/taggui/releases).
Choose the appropriate file for your operating system, extract it wherever you
want, and run the executable file inside.
You may have to install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to
extract the files if you don't have it on your system.

- macOS users: There is no macOS release because it requires a device running
  the OS, and I do not have one. You can still install and run the program
  manually (see below).
- Linux users: You may need to install `libxcb-cursor0`.
  (See [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75941575).)

Alternatively, you can install manually by cloning this repository and
installing the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
Run `taggui/run_gui.py` to start the program.
Python 3.12 is recommended, but Python 3.11 should also work.

## Usage

Load the directory containing your images by clicking the `Load Directory`
button in the center of the window (or `File` -> `Load Directory`).
Tags are loaded from `.txt` files in the directory with the same names as the
images.
Any changes you make to the tags are also automatically saved to these `.txt`
files.

## Automatic Captioning

<img src='images/auto-captioner-v1.18.0.png' alt='Auto-captioner screenshot' width='100%'>

In addition to manual tagging, you can automatically generate captions or tags
for your images inside TagGUI.
GPU generation requires a compatible NVIDIA GPU, and CPU generation is also
supported.

To use the feature, select the images you want to caption in the image list,
then select the captioning model you want to use in the Auto-Captioner pane.
If you have a local directory containing previously downloaded models, you can
set it in `File` -> `Settings` to include the models in the model list.
Click the `Start Auto-Captioning` button to start captioning.
You can select multiple images to batch generate captions for all of them.
It can take up to several minutes to download and load a model when you first
use it, but subsequent generations will be much faster.

### Captioning parameters

`Prompt`: Instructions given to the captioning model.
Prompt formats are handled automatically based on the selected model.
You can use the following template variables to dynamically insert information
about each image into the prompt:

- `{tags}`: The tags of the image, separated by commas.
- `{name}`: The file name of the image without the extension.
- `{directory}` or `{folder}`: The name of the directory containing the image.

An example prompt using a template variable could be
`Describe the image using the following tags as context: {tags}`.
With this prompt, `{tags}` would be replaced with the existing tags of each
image before the prompt is sent to the model.

`Start caption with`: Generated captions will start with this text.

`Remove tag separators in caption`: If checked, tag separators (commas by
default) will be removed from the generated captions.

`Discourage from caption`: Words or phrases that should not be present in the
generated captions.
You can separate multiple words or phrases with commas (`,`).
For example, you can put `appears,seems,possibly` to prevent the model from
using an uncertain tone in the captions.
The words may still be generated due to limitations related to tokenization.

`Include in caption`: Words or phrases that should be present somewhere in the
generated captions.
You can separate multiple words or phrases with commas (`,`).
You can also allow the captioning model to choose from a group of words or
phrases by separating them with `|`.
For example, if you put `cat,orange|white|black`, the model will attempt to
generate captions that contain the word `cat` and either `orange`, `white`,
or `black`.
It is not guaranteed that all of your specifications will be met.

`Tags to exclude` (WD Tagger models): Tags that should not be generated,
separated by commas.

Many of the other generation parameters are described in the
[Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig).

## Advanced Image List Filtering

The basic functionality of filtering for images that contain a certain tag is
available by clicking on the tag in the `All Tags` pane.
In addition to this, you can construct more complex filters in
the `Filter Images` box at the top of the `Images` pane.

### Filter criteria

These are the prefixes you can use to specify the filter criteria you want to
apply:

- `tag:`: Images that have the filter term as a tag
    - `tag:cat` will match images with the tag `cat`.
- `caption`: Images that contain the filter term in the caption
    - The caption is the list of tags as a single string, as it appears in the
      `.txt` file.
    - `caption:cat` will match images that have `cat` anywhere in the
      caption. For example, images with the tag `orange cat` or the
      tag `catastrophe`.
- `name`: Images that contain the filter term in the file name
    - `name:cat` will match images such as `cat-1.jpg` or `large_cat.png`.
- `path`: Images that contain the filter term in the full file path
    - `path:cat` will match images such as `C:\Users\cats\dog.jpg` or
      `/home/dogs/cat.jpg`.
- You can also use a filter term with no prefix to filter for images that
  contain the term in either the caption or the file path.
    - `cat` will match images containing `cat` in the caption or file path.

The following are prefixes for numeric filters. The operators `=` (`==` also
works), `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` are used to specify the type of
comparison.

- `tags`: Images that have the specified number of tags
    - `tags:=13` will match images that have exactly 13 tags.
    - `tags:!=7` will match images that do not have exactly 7 tags (images with
      less than 7 tags or more than 7 tags).
- `chars`: Images that have the specified number of characters in the caption
    - `chars:<100` will match images that have less than 100 characters in the
      caption.
    - `chars:>=30` will match images that have 30 or more characters in the
      caption.
- `tokens`: Images that have the specified number of tokens in the caption
    - `tokens:>75` will match images that have more than 75 tokens in the
      caption.
    - `tokens:<=50` will match images that have 50 or fewer tokens in the
      caption.

### Spaces and quotes

If the filter term contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotes (either
single or double quotes).
For example, to find images with the tag `orange cat`, you must
use `tag:"orange cat"` or `tag:'orange cat'`.
If you have both spaces and quotes in the filter term, you can escape the
quotes with backslashes.
For example, you can use `tag:"orange \"cat\""` for the tag `orange "cat"`.
An alternative is to use different types of quotes for the outer and inner
quotes, like so: `tag:'orange "cat"'`.

### Wildcards

You can use the `*` character as a wildcard to match any number of any
characters, and the `?` character to match any single character.
For example, `tag:*cat` will match images with tags like `orange cat`,
`large cat`, and `cat`.

### Combining filters

Logical operators can be used to combine multiple filters:

- `NOT`: Images that do not match the filter
    - `NOT tag:cat` will match images that do not have the tag `cat`.
- `AND`: Images that match both filters before and after the operator
    - `tag:cat AND tag:orange` will match images that have both the tag `cat`
      and the tag `orange`.
- `OR`: Images that match either filter before or after the operator
    - `tag:cat OR tag:dog` will match images that have either the tag `cat` or
      the tag `dog`, or both.

The lowercase versions of these operators will also work: `not`, `and`,
and `or`.

The operator precedence is `NOT` > `AND` > `OR`, so by default, `NOT` will be
evaluated first, then `AND`, then `OR`.
You can use parentheses to change this order.
For example, in `tag:cat AND (tag:orange OR tag:white)`, the `OR` will be
evaluated first, matching images that have the tag `cat` and either the
tag `orange` or the tag `white`.
You can nest parentheses and operators to create arbitrarily complex filters.
